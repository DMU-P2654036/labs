          That was your first free day in a long time. You decided to go on a
          trip to the forest. The closest one you could find was where no one
          goes because of scary stories about it. You didn't believe in such
          things and didn't want to travel more far than necessary. The road you
          took was very foggy. You stopped your car and thought about going home
          because of the weather.
